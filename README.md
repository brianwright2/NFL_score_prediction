2. Download NFL spread data here: https://www.kaggle.com/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data#spreadspoke_scores.csv
3. Run compile_data.py in terminal with 2 command line inputs: filepath to play by play data and filepath to spread data
    e.g. python compile_data.py nfl.csv nflspread.csv
4. This will create a csv called nfl_cleaned.csv in your directory.
